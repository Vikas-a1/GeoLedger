# Architecture

GeoLedger is a three-layer cadastral registry prototype. Land parcels are stored off-chain with GIS metadata and supporting documents. Ownership is anchored on an Ethereum-compatible smart contract when a reviewer approves an application.

## Layers

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix/shadcn-style UI, Leaflet/react-leaflet, Axios, and ethers.js.

The live application lives under `frontend/src/app/`. `frontend/src/App.tsx` re-exports that router. A second, older copy of some screens exists under `frontend/src/components/` and is not what `main.tsx` mounts.

The browser talks to the Flask API for registry data. Identity is the connected MetaMask account (`eth_requestAccounts` via ethers `BrowserProvider`). On connect, the app asks MetaMask to switch to Hardhat Localhost (chain 31337) and registers the address with `POST /auth/register`. Contract writes still go through the backend registrar key, not the user’s MetaMask signature.

### Backend (`backend/`)

Flask application factory in `backend/app.py`. CORS is enabled for all origins. Blueprints are registered from `backend/routes/__init__.py`.

Typical request path:

1. Route in `backend/routes/`
2. Controller in `backend/controllers/` (thin HTTP adapter)
3. Service in `backend/services/` (business rules)
4. Dataclass models in `backend/models/`
5. Persistence through `database.client.get_database()`

Blockchain writes go through `BlockchainService`, which uses Web3.py against the Hardhat RPC and the ABI at `backend/blockchain/GeoLedger.json`.

### Blockchain (`blockchain/`)

Hardhat 3 workspace. Solidity `^0.8.20`. The contract stores `propertyId → { owner, registeredAt, exists }`. The deployer is the `registrar` and may transfer any parcel. Current owners may also transfer their own parcels.

`deploy-local.js` deploys the compiled artifact, copies the ABI into the backend, and writes `BLOCKCHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` into `backend/.env` if that file exists.

## Persistence

`database/client.py` tries MongoDB first (`MONGO_URI`, default `mongodb://localhost:27017`, database `geoledger`). If the ping fails, it falls back to `backend/geoledger.db` via `SQLiteDatabase`, a Mongo-like wrapper over SQLite tables.

On first empty property collection, `seed_data.py` inserts demo parcel `SN-DEMO-001` (Thandavapura, Nanjangud, Mysuru) owned by Hardhat account `0xf39F…2266`.

Collections: `users`, `properties`, `applications`, `documents`, `transactions`.

## GIS

`GISService` loads `backend/geojson/demo_parcels.json`. If the survey number is not in that file, it synthesizes a rectangular polygon near Mysuru (`12.18°N, 76.68°E`) from an MD5 of the survey number so the map always has something to draw.

## Security model (prototype)

- Documents are hashed with SHA-256 at upload time and stored on disk under `UPLOAD_FOLDER`.
- Reviewers mark documents `VERIFIED` or `REJECTED`. Integrity re-check recomputes the file hash and compares it to the stored hash.
- On-chain writes are signed by the backend's `BLOCKCHAIN_PRIVATE_KEY` (the registrar account), not by the applicant's wallet.
- There is no JWT/session middleware. The SPA treats the MetaMask account as the session (`localStorage` flag + `eth_accounts` restore). `POST /auth/register` stores the wallet if it is new.
- CORS is wide open. Treat this as a local demo, not a production registry.
